# serjoBoto

SerjoBoto is a discord bot which I have started to work on. At the moment I don't have a specific category of things that I want it to do, 
it's more like a sandbox for me to try and add different features as I think of them. For now the bot isn't hosted but I'm thinking about,
using my raspberry pi to do so.

some commands:

!random: genearates a random number from 1-100.

!flip: flips a coin.

!civ,{civilization}: replace {civilization} with a faction from the game Civilization VI to then return the unique features of the faction.
(this uses beautifulsoup to webscrape the data.) 

!quote: prints out a random quote retrieved from an API.

passive:

whenever someone sends a message that contains "my friend", the bot will then send a message saying "MY FRIENDDD!!!". (This isn't a very 
useful feature, it's just an inside joke with some friends)
